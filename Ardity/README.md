# Ardity


Notes...
- It is better to install ardity from git (download and import it as a custom package from assets tab) and not from asset store.
- On my PC it has some problems with COM ports but on the notebook(13) worked pretty well.
- Main git repo is --- > <a href="https://ardity.dwilches.com/">HERE</a>
